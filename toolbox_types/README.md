# Toolbox (library)

> [!WARNING]  
> While the toolbox runtime library is intended to be included in other applications, the API is not yet stable and most features are missing. As such, we recommend you **do not use** this code at this time.

## Getting Started
Usage outside of the playground is not supported at this time.

## Documentation
Toolbox documentation is included as rustdoc comments. Currently, documentation isn't a priority and the existing documentation is very incomplete.
